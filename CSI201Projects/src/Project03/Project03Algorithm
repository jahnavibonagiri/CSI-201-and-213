Jahnavi Bonagiri Project 03 Algorithm
Summary: This program reads input of two different dates and uses mathematical operations and decision structure to calculate the date difference.
1. Declare variables in the beginning of program.
2. Reads the first month as string.
3. Reads the first year date as a double.
4. Reads the second month as a string.
5. Reads the second year date as a double.
6. Uses if and else if statements to assign a integer number to the first string month.
7. Uses if and else if statements to assign a integer number to the second string month.
8. If first year is greater than or equal to the second year, there will be a subset of decision structures to follow. 
9. If first year is greater than or equal to second year and month 1 is greater than or equal to second month, calculate the month difference and year difference. 
10. If first year is greater than or equal to second year and month 1 is less than second month, calculate the month difference and year difference.
11. If first year less than the second year, there will be a subset of decision structures to follow. 
12. If first year less than second year and month 1 greater than second month, calculate the month difference and year difference. 
13. Add +=12 to month difference to make the month difference non-negative
14. Subtract 1 from yearsdifference to calculate the correct difference.
15. If first year less than second year and month 1 less than second month, calculate the month difference and year difference. 
16. Display the difference between the two dates.
